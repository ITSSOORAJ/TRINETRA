## **Introduction:**  

Trinetra is a **Remote Face Recognition System** designed for **high-precision identity verification** and **real-time surveillance**. Unlike traditional models, Trinetra is engineered to recognize **only authorized individuals**, ensuring **zero false positives** while maintaining **lag-free performance** across multiple cameras.  

With a **custom-built face recognition model**, Trinetra eliminates the dependency on pre-trained networks, providing **high-speed recognition, multi-camera support, and instant alerts** in a scalable architecture.  

## **System Architecture:**  

Trinetra follows a **three-tier architecture**:  

1️⃣ **Dataset Generation Module** – Captures and augments facial data to ensure accuracy and robustness.  
2️⃣ **Training Engine** – Custom-built deep learning model utilizing **Siamese Neural Networks (SNN)** for two-step identity verification.  
3️⃣ **Surveillance & Alert System** – Multi-camera real-time tracking, **instant email notifications**, and location mapping.  

**Efficient, reliable, and AI-powered surveillance is the future of security.**  

## **Hardware/Software Requirements:**  

### **Hardware**  

- **CPU:** Intel i5 or higher  
- **RAM:** 4GB or higher  
- **Storage:** Minimum 10GB free space  
- **Camera:** Any high-resolution webcam or IP camera  
- **Additional:** GPS module (for location mapping)  

### **Software**  

- **Operating System:** Windows / Linux / macOS  
- **Database Server:** MySQL / PostgreSQL  
- **Database Connectivity:** MySQL Connector  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django)  
- **Frontend:** ReactJS / NextJS  
- **AI/ML Frameworks:** OpenCV, TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- **Messaging:** SMTP for email alerts  

## **Working:**  

This project consists of **four key modules**:  

1️⃣ **Dataset Generation**  
- Automatically **augments** facial data with **50+ variations** to enhance accuracy.  
- Ensures robustness against **lighting, angles, and occlusions**.  

2️⃣ **Training Engine**  
- **Custom-built deep learning model** (no pre-trained solutions).  
- **Siamese Neural Network (SNN)** for **two-step verification** using feature embeddings.  
- Optimized for **high accuracy and real-time speed**.  

3️⃣ **Surveillance System**  
- Multi-camera integration for **live tracking**.  
- **Lag-free frame processing** with real-time detection.  
- Works seamlessly across multiple devices.  

4️⃣ **Alert & Notification System**  
- **Instant email alerts** with name, image, and camera location when a person is identified.  
- **Zero false positives** – only authorized individuals are recognized.  

## **Prerequisites:**  

- Ensure all **cameras** are properly configured and accessible.  
- Set up the **database connection** before running the application.  
- Configure **SMTP settings** for email notifications.  
- Delete any previous recognition logs before training a new dataset.  

## **Compatible Hardware:**  

Trinetra is compatible with the following **camera models**:  

- **Any IP Camera** supporting RTSP streams  
- **USB Webcams** (minimum 720p resolution)  
- **Mobile phone cameras** (via external integration)
